# first-NEW

A second take on my first React practice project, now with functioning implementation of React Router and with basic Node.js/Express server setup. This is a small responsive website for pets hotel with three pages. 

## Screenshots:

## Technologies: 
ReactJS, Typescript, Bootstrap 4, Node.js, Express

If you want to take a look, just clone the project or download a .zip file, and run the following command in the terminal: 
```
npm run dev

```

## Important note: 
Covalence boilerplate (https://github.com/covalence-io/barebones-react-typescript-express) was used for this project, so if you interested in additional info, be sure to check the link above.
